# SENDNOMAD INTERNATIONAL MONEY TRANSFERS VIA CRYPTOCURRENCY
 
## Overview and Origin
 
SendNomad is the name of the company.  It is a US fin-tech startup founded in 2021 that offers "fast and affordable" international money transfer services.
 
Its founders are Kairat Ashim and Elezhan Zhakia, originally from Kazakhstan who studied and graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). They are also the alumni of MIT's YCombinatior startup accelerator program.  Their working experience after graduation counts several jobs with some of the US well known IT companies.
 
During their studies and work in the US they were looking for a reliable, fast and inexpensive  way to transfer money from the United States to their friends and relatives in Kazakhstan and Russia.
 
However the incumbent providers either offered money transfer services for the high price (fees) or bundled such services with low and unattractive rates of exchange of the US Dollar to Kazakh Tenge or Russian Ruble.  After doing some research the future startup founders realized that this problem is ubiquitous. The high fees and the speed of transferring money concerned many other existing or potential customers of such services.  That spurred their interest in the design of a new product aimed at making the money transfers between countries fast and affordable.
 
## Product / Service
 
As a result of their search and efforts they created a new App. Unlike other services of other providers, this service has no commission and the rates of the currency exchange is equal to the ForEx exchange at the time when a transaction takes place. The transaction processing time  is within 15 -  30 minutes. Unregistered service users can transfer up to 1,000 USD a month.  Those who successfully passed registration and verification are limited to 7,500 USD a month.  The App allows to transfer directly to a debit /credit card and to more than 100 so called electronic wallets.
  
## Technology

Traditional financial institutions, such as banks, in their international money transfer business heavily rely on the US dollar as a clearance currency and use a system of inter-bank correspondent accounts supported by automatic transfer systems such as SWIFT. Every transfer passes through a chain of the accounts belonging to different institutions each charging its own commission eventually resulting in high fees relayed to consumers.  In addition to commissions and fees the interbank system SWIFT can be used as a political instrument against certain countries and their financial systems.  This is what happened with Russia where many banks were cut off SWIFT after February 2022.  
As an alternative Sendnomad processes international transfers using crypto currency.  It accepts US Dollars or the currencies of other countries, such as Euro, and then converts them into crypto currency.  The founders choose Stablecoins such as USDT for that purpose as its rate pegged to the USD  and therefore provides some stability.  After that the crypto currency is converted into the currency of the country of recipient (e.g Russian Ruble).  Finally the funds in the recipient currency are transferred using  the means available domestically in  the country of the  recipient - either bank accounts or numerous electronic wallets. Transactions in crypto currencies have no specific location, jurisdiction,  borders, they are decentralized  and therefore less vulnerable to any political agenda.
 
## Company Funding
 
The company founders idea happened to appeal to some investors as the startup raised $760,000 during  the seed round  of financing in April 2022. The pool of investors included  Prasanna, CapitalX, Astrit Ventures, Pareto, and Jacques.
 
## Market.  Competitive Landscape
 
The company site and founders claim that currently the company operates in 32 countries, and  the main markets are the EU, the countries of Latin America. 
 
However, viewing recent geopolitical developments in Eastern Europe along with the technology that the company uses, anyone may conclude the main focus group of customers are those individuals interested in transferring money from abroad to Russia. That is apparently the company's raison d'Ãªtre for now.
 
With the exodus of international money transfer operators as Western Union, PayPal, Money Gramm from the Russian market along with western sanctions imposed on Russian banks and other financial institutions the company's services seem to be indispensable and among the very rare if not the last resort for those individuals interested in transferring money to Russia from abroad.
 
There seem to be many of those who live and work abroad (US and Europe) from time to time trying to send money to their families and relatives back in home as well as employees of US and European companies such as IT professionals residing in and working remotely in Russia and receiving their wages from abroad.  And there are others.
 
Although it's difficult to estimate the market size for such services in money equivalent, the number of the individuals potentially interested in such services in the US is impressive.  There are at least 5.5 million Russian speaking residents in the US with ties in Russia.
  
## Results
 
Statistics about the company achievements in terms of such  metrics as number of customers, total sum of transactions fulfilled so far apparently are unavailable. Nothing was found.
 
Something which is intangible and rather not measurable is the fact that the company has become known among potential customers interested in such types of services. 
 
## Recommendations
 
The main problem is the reputation of the company and its services.  It is still  in the gray / twilight zone and has to be somehow  built. Some sites publishing different reviews rate SendNomad service as one with low trust / quality while others give average ratings, which represent rather an opportunity for improvement.
 
Another growing market for the company could be solutions for those Russian residents interested in paying for goods and services abroad.  Visa, Mastercard, UnionPay cards issued in Russia do not allow you to pay abroad anymore beginning from the year 2022.  Turkish cards Troy and Russian Mir are of limited use abroad. Opening an account abroad is a hassle. In many European countries you can not open a bank account distantly from Russia or being on tourist or visitor visa without permanent or temporary residency in those countries.
 
The services and products other than money transfers from abroad to Russia can be a diversification strategy and mitigate the risks of something that may  unexpectedly happen among the geo-political turmoil in Eastern Europe.
 
The technology used by SendNomad based on crypto currency and its exchange from one currency to another can be also used for the abroad payment services.   Crypto currencies so far has not been strictly controlled by the governments / countries / political blocks and they are not influenced by sanctions.
